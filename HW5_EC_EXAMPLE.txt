== copyabode <source-dir> <target-dir> ==
/*
 * Copies the directory "source-dir" and all its subdirectories as a subdirectory of "target-dir".
 * Returns 0 if successful, 1 if any errors were encountered.
 */

Implemented with a recursive helper function and a modified coppy function, coppyDirect.


-- Example usage --

Let sourcedir be the following directory:
    |- sourcedir
    |  |- folder1
    |  |  |- textinfolder1.txt
    |  |- text
    |  |- folder2
    |  |  |- folder3
    |  |     |- textinfolder3.file
Let targetdir be a user-inputted directory that does not yet exist.
With * representing our recursion depth, the function will perform as follows:

# coppyabode sourcedir targetdir

Make directory "targetdir"
* Open directory stream "sourcedir" and read:
    * "folder1" is a directory. Make directory "targetdir/folder1" and recurse...
    ** Open directory stream "folder1" and read:
           ** "textinfolder1.txt" is a file. Copy from "sourcedir/folder1/textinfolder1.txt" to "targetdir/folder1/textinfolder1.txt"
    * "text" is a file. Copy from "sourcedir/text" to "targetdir/text"
    * "folder2" is a directory. Make directory "targetdir/folder2" and recurse...
    ** Open directory stream "folder2" and read:
        ** "folder3" is a directory. Make directory "targetdir/folder2/folder3" and recurse...
        *** Open directory stream "folder3" and read:
            *** "textinfolder3.file" is a file. Copy from "targetdir/folder2/folder3/textinfolder3.txt" to "targetdir/folder2/folder3/textinfolder3.txt"
Done!
